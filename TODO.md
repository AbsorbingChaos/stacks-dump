TODO
- document miner output
- make key registration optional

DONE
+ show empty block count
+ show orphan block count
+ show `>` on first stx block height, why is it displayed twice, seems always the same value anyway
+ actual win % would be more useful per miner rather than global
+ last commit / miner
+ document block output
